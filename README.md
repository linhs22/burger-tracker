# Sequelize Burger Tracker

## Description

![burger logger](./public/assets/css/images/burglogger.png)


This is a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Functionality for this application include letting users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

This is similar to the Burger logger that I have done before, but this time we are using sequelize to retrieve the data. Sequelize shortens the queries so that it is more user friendly and easier to type.
